Graphical interface to conda to manage environments

For now, this is a finger excercise to see how a graphical user interface to conda could look like.

If the excersise succeeds, this should maybe become a package that:

   1. Implements the plugin to [Spyder-IDE](https://github.com/spyder-ide) (V5?)
   2. Also works stand-alone, so it can be added to [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) to provide 'graphical installers'
