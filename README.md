# conda-gui
Graphical interface to conda to manage environments.

## Intend
For now, this is a finger excercise to see how a graphical user interface to conda could look like.

If the excersise succeeds, this could maybe become a package that:

   1. Implements the plugin to [Spyder-IDE](https://github.com/spyder-ide) 😍
   2. Also works stand-alone, so it can be added to [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) to provide 'graphical management' 🤤 🙉🙈🙊

## Interesting resources

## Conclusion

Turns out that there **is** already such a thing available (at least for Spyder 3) !!!
